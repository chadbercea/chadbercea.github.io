# First Principles

## What This Is

A personal landing page that serves as a central hub for navigating to various projects and work.

## Core Purpose

- **Routing**: Direct visitors to projects hosted across different platforms
- **Discovery**: Make it easy to find and explore my work
- **Centralization**: One URL to rule them all

## Deployment Strategy

Projects are primarily deployed on GitHub Pages, but the hub is platform-agnostic:

- GitHub Pages (primary)
- Other hosting providers as needed
- External services and platforms

## Philosophy

Keep it simple. This page exists to point people in the right direction, not to be the destination itself.
